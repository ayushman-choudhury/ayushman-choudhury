# Ayushman Choudhury

Hello! I'm a senior at Brown University (Class of 2025), studying Applied Mathematics â€” Computer Science, and Music, pursuing graduate studies at the intersection of Climate Science and Mathematics.

Highlights of my coursework include Dynamical Systems, ODEs/PDEs, Computational Probability and Statistics, Computational Linear Algebra, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Science, Climate Modeling, and Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning. On the coding front, I've found myself at home with Python, R, and MATLAB, but I have prior experiences in Java, C/C++, SQL, and Angular (HTML/CSS/TypeScript). 

My long-term goal is to apply my love of mathematical puzzles, aided by modern computational power, towards humanity's responses to our multifaceted climate crises. I have been generally concerned about climate change since high school, but through my coursework and research experience at Brown, I have begun to feel a higher calling to do everything that I can, with the skills that I have, to secure as stable a climate as possible for future generations. Two recent life-changing research experiences (Spring 2024 at Brown and Summer 2024 at WUSM in St. Louis) have convinced me to pursue the academia route; currently applying to PhD programs at the intersection of Climate Science and Mathematics.

Some recent experiences:
- 2024-2025: Research in the [Freilich Lab](https://mara-freilich.github.io/) at Brown University for my senior thesis. Investigating the impacts of mesoscale eddies on the carbon and heat flux dynamics of the Southern Ocean, and thus our global ocean and climate systems. Advised by Professor Mara Freilich (APMA/EEPS) and [Dr. Lily Dove](https://lily-dove.github.io/).
- Fall 2024: Data Science Fellow with Brown's [Data Science Institute](https://dsi.brown.edu/), developing curriculum with EEPS Professor Seda Salap-Ayca for an upcoming Advanced GIS course.
- Summer 2024: Research in the [CausAI Lab](https://causailab.github.io/)  at the Institute for Informatics, Data Science, and Biostatistics at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. Investigated socio-economic impacts on food allergy hospitalizations using Causal Inference. Advised by Professor [Linying Zhang](https://linyingzhang.com/).
