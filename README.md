# Ayushman Choudhury

Hello there! I'm Ayushman Choudhury. I'm a first-year PhD Student at the University of Chicago's [Department of Geophysical Sciences](https://geosci.uchicago.edu), advised by [Professor B. B. Cael](https://geosci.uchicago.edu/people/b-b-cael/). I'm currently researching Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement; my broader goal is to bring a mathematical and data-driven voice to finding interdisciplinary solutions to our climate crisis.

Recent Updates
======

- January 2026: Visiting Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique (LMD) in Paris for the next two months! Working with Laurent Bopp and Lester Kwiatkowski on 1D and 3D models for Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement.
- August 2025: Wrapped up my curriculum development work with EEPS Professor Seda Salap-Ayca, for her upcoming Advanced GIS course. The last work I'll do at Brown... for now! 
- April 2025: Presented my senior thesis on mesoscale eddies at the inaugural DEEPS Dive Undergraduate Research Symposium!

About me
======

Ever since I could count, I've had a fascination for numerical and computational puzzles, and been a self-described math nerd for as long as I can remember. Something about putting together disparate pieces of a puzzle, and using logical reasoning and numerical tools to connect them into a solution, has always been deeply satisfying to me. As I grew up, the mathematics I studied increased in difficulty, but this feeling of "playing with numbers" never left me. 

Meanwhile, I began to become aware of the broader problem of global warming and climate change. Books, TV documentaries, and news stories all captured my attention — frightening me of potential futures, but also inspiring me to work towards better futures in whatever way I could. Memories from my childhood include lobbying my parents to replace our SUV with a plug-in hybrid (an effort that yielded success in high school) and to add solar panels to our roof (which happened just after I had left for college).

I studied at Brown University from 2021-2025, and graduated with concentrations in Applied Mathematics, Computer Science, and Music. 
I wrote two honors theses:
- for Applied Mathematics, I studied the heat and salt fluxes of mesoscale eddies in the Southern Ocean (along the Antarctic Circumpolar Current around the Southeast Indian Ridge) by aligning surface-visible data from Copernicus and AVISO satellites with subsurface eddy data from BGC Argo floats and an undersea SWOT glider. This research was advised by Professor [Mara Freilich](https://mara-freilich.github.io/) and then-postdoc now-Professor [Lily Dove](https://eas.gatech.edu/people/lily-dove).

- for Music, I developed a method for algorithmic composition using Python, and presented a concert of music centered around Python-generated sounds. I explored topics like Data Sonification (using pitch, timbre, and rhythm of sounds to represent data) and Human-Computer Interactions (having my friends play duets with this Python-generated music). This thesis was advised by Professor [Lu Wang](https://www.wanglucomposer.com/about/index.html). 

As a PhD student at UChicago, I'm excited to continue studying the mathematics of climate change — focusing especially on our oceans — and work towards interdisciplinary solutions to mitigate its effects.
